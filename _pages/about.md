## 🧪 Technical Domains

At NeureonMindFlux Research Lab, we engage in the design and implementation of applied artificial intelligence systems grounded in emerging and hybrid technologies. Our technical domains span across:

- **Advanced Programming Environments**  
  Expertise in Python, Julia, and C/C++ for high-performance computing, with emphasis on scientific libraries and modular architectures.

- **Quantum Computing & Simulation**  
  Hands-on development using **Qiskit**, **Cirq**, and custom quantum simulators. Proficient in quantum key distribution protocols such as **BB84**, quantum gates modeling, and hybrid quantum-classical frameworks for secure data processing.

- **AI & Deep Learning Frameworks**  
  Applied use of **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **Keras** for building interpretable and scalable neural architectures. We specialize in cognitive agents, reinforcement learning, and few-shot learning models with meta-learning capabilities.

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**  
  Integration of **lattice-based encryption** (e.g., Dilithium, Kyber) with classical/quantum hybrid channels. Our focus includes secure AI-driven authentication protocols and post-quantum key exchange mechanisms.

- **Modular and Distributed AI Systems**  
  Design of self-contained agents and microservices for decentralized cognition, including **ROS**, **Docker**, **gRPC**, and modular message-based protocols for AI in constrained environments (e.g., robotics, edge computing).

- **Cognitive Modeling & Agent Architectures**  
  Simulation of conscious and self-reflective behavior in agents using hybrid symbolic–connectionist architectures. Includes attention modeling, memory dynamics, and self-modeling agents for AGI.

- **AI Interpretability & Simulation Tools**  
  Implementation of explainable AI systems with focus on **SHAP**, **LIME**, causal inference, and counterfactual reasoning. Simulation environments include **Unity ML**, custom-built simulators, and OpenAI Gym-like ecosystems.

- **Applied AI for Infrastructure and Space Systems**  
  Research in real-world deployment of AI in aerospace systems, industrial control, precision agriculture, and intelligent urban infrastructure. Use of sensor fusion, predictive maintenance algorithms, and autonomous decision pipelines.

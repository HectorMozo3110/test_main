## Abstract {#abstract}
The Neural-Augmented Self-Modeling Agents Framework is a modular system that enables artificial agents to analyze and adapt their own internal cognitive states in real time. It uses neural models to monitor variables such as confidence, fatigue, and behavioral mode, and employs a meta-learner to interpret these signals and support introspective adjustments. Designed for both single-agent and multi-agent environments, the framework helps agents improve behavioral stability, manage exploration-exploitation balance, and exhibit measurable forms of self-awareness. It includes tools for scientific visualization, reproducible metrics, and flexible configuration, offering a practical platform for research in meta-cognitive AI and adaptive intelligent systems.


## 1.Statement of Need
As artificial intelligence systems become more autonomous and embedded in real-world environments, the ability for agents to analyze and adapt their own internal cognitive statesâ€”such as confidence, fatigue, and behavioral modeâ€”has become essential for building resilient and trustworthy systems[^1],[^2]. While theoretical models in cognitive science and AI have explored self-monitoring and introspective processes[^3],[^4], practical tools that implement these capabilities remain scarce.

Recent studies in meta-cognitive frameworks and self-organizing systems have shown that agents capable of observing and interpreting their own behavior can improve decision-making stability and adaptability[^5],[^6]. However, most open-source platforms still focus on externally supervised behavior, lacking mechanisms for internal feedback and self-regulation.

The Neural-Augmented Self-Modeling Agents Framework addresses this gap by offering a practical, modular system where agents can introspectively analyze their internal dynamics and adjust in real time. This design enables the study and deployment of agents with emergent self-awareness and adaptive autonomy across diverse environments and applications[^7].


## 2.Software description
The Neural-Augmented Self-Modeling Agents Framework is structured around a modular architecture designed for transparency, adaptability, and scientific reproducibility. Each component is independently configurable, enabling researchers and developers to experiment with various levels of introspection, adaptation, and coordination. The system supports both single-agent and multi-agent setups, and its internal communication is structured to simulate cognitive autonomy rather than centralized control.

### 2.1 Architecture Overview
At its core, the framework is composed of four main modules:

At its core, the framework is composed of four main modules:

- **Agent Core**  
  Handles perception, basic behavior selection, and interaction with the environment. This module remains intentionally agnostic of the internal state modeling, maintaining a separation between reactive and introspective processes.

- **Self-Monitoring Subsystem**  
  Collects and updates internal cognitive variables such as `confidence`, `fatigue`, and `behavioral_mode`. These variables reflect the agentâ€™s operational state and are observable both internally and externally.

- **Meta-Learner Module**  
  Acts as an introspective analyzer. It receives inputs from the self-monitoring subsystem and dynamically interprets them to recommend behavioral adjustments. It does not enforce control, but rather informs decisions based on learned patterns.

- **Visualization and Export Tools**  
  Provide real-time dashboards, introspection logs, and scientific metric tracking. The system outputs structured data that can be used for reproducible experiments, publications, or AI behavior auditing.

### 2.2 Self-Monitoring and Internal Variables

Each agent in the framework continuously monitors its internal cognitive dynamics through a dedicated self-observation module. This subsystem tracks three primary variables:

- `confidence`: a dynamic estimate of decision reliability.  
- `fatigue`: a measure of cognitive resource depletion or overload.  
- `behavioral_mode`: a categorical signal representing current strategic intent (e.g., explore vs. exploit).

These variables evolve during interaction and are updated based on observed outcomes. They are made explicitly available for both internal decision processes and external visualization. Researchers can access them in real time or export them for offline analysis, enabling precise evaluation of agent cognition and adaptation over time.

### 2.3 Meta-Learner Module

The meta-learner is a central analytic component that interprets internal state variables without enforcing behavioral decisions. It operates independently from the core controller, analyzing trends in `confidence`, `fatigue`, and `behavioral_mode` to detect anomalies, phase shifts, or potential adaptation triggers.

Rather than issuing commands, the meta-learner provides meta-level feedback that agents can use to self-modulate. This separation of analysis and execution promotes interpretability and enables comparative studies across different agent architectures. The module is fully agnostic to the specific implementation of the agents, making it reusable and extensible.

### 2.4 Multi-Agent Support

The framework supports environments populated with multiple self-modeling agents running in parallel. Each agent maintains its own internal self-model, meta-learner process, and behavioral regulation loop, operating autonomously without requiring direct communication.

This design enables the study of emergent coordination, implicit alignment, and distributed meta-cognitive dynamics. Researchers can run controlled experiments where heterogeneous agents independently adapt to shared or individual environments, opening new directions in collaborative autonomy and adaptive swarm intelligence.

### 2.5 Instrumentation and Output

To facilitate scientific reproducibility and rigorous evaluation, the framework includes robust instrumentation tools:

- Real-time dashboards for monitoring cognitive state evolution  
- Internal logs of variable updates and meta-learner analyses  
- Export options in CSV, JSON, and structured logs for offline analysis  
- Visualization modules for time-series introspection and behavioral annotation  

These outputs provide clear insight into each agentâ€™s internal processes and support transparent, data-driven analysis of learning dynamics and self-awareness metrics.
